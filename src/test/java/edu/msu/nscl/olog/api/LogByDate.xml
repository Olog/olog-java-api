There is no water on the panels. According to Geroge Ganetis:\n  The front of one of the panels is open because of a lock.    \nThe water on the floor is from a hydrostatic test on the water system and this water is from a valve.  Nobody had cleaned it up.  There is no danger unless we are working there and we are not.</description><attachments/><logbooks><logbook name="Operations"/></logbooks><properties/><tags/></log><log createdDate="2012-03-28T18:42:31-04:00" id="60145" level="Info" modifiedDate="2012-03-28T18:42:31-04:00" version="1"><description>There is water on the floor by the 2 electrical panels by the bathroom.
